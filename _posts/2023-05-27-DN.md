title: Predicting neuronal dynamics with a delayed gain control model
---

* Visual neurons respond to static images with specific dynamics: neuronal responses sum sub-additively over time, reduce in amplitude with repeated or sustained stimuli (neuronal adaptation), and are slower at low stimulus contrast. 

* We propose a simple delayed normalization model that predicts these seemingly disparate response patterns observed in a diverse set of measurementsâ€“intracranial electrodes in patients, fMRI, and macaque single unit spiking. 

* Fitting the model to intracranial EEG data uncovers two regularities across human visual field maps: estimated linear filters (temporal receptive fields) systematically differ across and within visual field maps, and later areas exhibit more rapid and substantial gain control. The model is further generalizable to account for dynamics of contrast-dependent spike rates in macaque V1, and amplitudes of fMRI BOLD in human V1.
