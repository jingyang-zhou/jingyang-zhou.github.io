title: How does perceptual discriminability relate to neuronal receptive fields?
---

* Our perception changes only when underlying neuronal responses change. Because visual neurons preferentially respond to some pixel adjustments in an image, perceptually we are more sensitive to change in some pixel combinations more than others. 

* We examined how perceptual discriminability varies to arbitrary image perturbations assuming canonical models of neuronal responses. In particular, we assume discriminability reflects the magnitude of change (L2 norm) in neuronal responses, and we examined how perceptual discrim- inability relates to deterministic and stochastic neuronal computations.
