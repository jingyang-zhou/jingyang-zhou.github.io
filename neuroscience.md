## Representational dissimilarity metric spaces for stochastic neural networks

* Existing methods compare deterministic responses (e.g. artificial networks that lack stochastic layers) or averaged responses (e.g., trial-averaged firing rates in biological data). However, these measures of deterministic representational similarity ignore the scale and geometric structure of noise, both of which play important roles in neural computation. 

* We generalize previously proposed shape metrics (Williams et al., 2021) to quantify differences in stochastic representations. These new distances satisfy the triangle inequality, and thus can be used as a rigorous basis for many supervised and unsupervised analyses. 

* We find that the stochastic geometries of neurobiological representations of oriented visual gratings and naturalistic scenes respectively resemble untrained and trained deep network representations. Further, we are able to more accurately predict certain network attributes (e.g. training hyperparameters) from its position in stochastic (versus deterministic) shape space


## Delayed normalization model captures disparate nonlinear neural dynamics measured with different techniques in macaque and human V1

* Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) is a powerful method for measuring neural population responses from the cortex of awake, behaving, subjects. Here we used VSDI to measure the
dynamics of neural population responses in macaque V1 to visual stimuli with a wide range of time courses.

* We found that beyond clear nonlinearities for briefly presented visual stimuli, stimulus-evoked VSDI responses are near additive in time. These results are qualitatively different from neural dynamics to similar stimuli previously measured in human visual cortex using fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG), which show strong sub-additivity in time.

* To test whether this discrepancy is specific to VSDI, a signal dominated by subthreshold neural activity, we repeated our measurements using a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP), a signal dominated by spiking activity. We found that GCaMP signals in macaque V1 are also nearadditive. 

* We show that a simple yet flexible delayed normalization model can capture the dynamics of all of these measurements, suggesting that dynamic gain-control is an important mechanism contributing to neural processing in the brain.
