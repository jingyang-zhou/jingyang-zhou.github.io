## Interview for the Flatiron Scientist Spotlight Series

Scientists and philosophers have long been fascinated with how we perceive the world around us. 
In the era of high-powered computing, researchers are taking new approaches to old questions about perception. 
Here is the [link](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2023/02/10/a-new-era-of-perception-research/) to the interview.

## Manhattan Representational Geometry workshop

I co-organized the workshop with Nikolaus Kriegeskorte, Heiko Schuett and Xue-Xin Wei, and the workshop took place at Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute on January 6th and 7th, 2023. The workshop focused on:

* Clarifying the theory and mathematical foundation related to representational geometries;
* Updating the participants about theoretical and methodological developments and shared resources (e.g. data, code)
* Developing collaborations that connect theoretical ideas about representational geometry to experiments, including existing and future large-scale behavioral and brain-activity measurements.
